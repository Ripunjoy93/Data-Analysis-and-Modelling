## Data-Analysis-and-Modelling

**This repository consits of various data analysis steps starting from data cleaning to exploratory analysis to builing a model to evaluation of model.**

_In a nutshell, this repository I will be using various examples to show different steps of data analysis. I will be using mainly **R** and **Python** for analysis or to plot graphs or to build model and for other important steps of analysis_

#### Important Points :
+ There will be two folders, one is for data-sets and one is for notebooks showing analysis over some datasets.
+ I will be using publicly available datasets. Most of them you can download from the mentioned link.
+ Each notebook will have a serial number. And basic description about that analysis and model, tool use will be in this README file.
+ You can visit the particular notebook if you are interested in that analysis.

> The sole purpose of this repository is ```LEARNING```. Any suggestion or question regarding any particular analysis is highly welcome.
